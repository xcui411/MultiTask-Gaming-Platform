About the Gauge-monitoring task
      The green area is the safe area, and the red areas (both upper and lower red areas) are dangerous areas. 
      Your task is to correct the pointer (the white bar) when it moves from the safe area to either dangerous area. 
      When the pointer moves to the upper red area, you can press "↓" to make it back to the green area.
      When the pointer moves to the lower red area, you can press "↑" to make it back to the green area.
